          Hi, my name is Frederika and I love to listen to music. Do you?
<br />
If you do, you will probably have fun making a playlist of your favourite songs. With the Playlist Creator you can!
<br />
          <br />
          You can add songs with artist, genre and a rating.
          <br />
          Once you created a playlist you can sort it by songtitle, artist, genre and rating.
          <br /><br />
                    The making of this playlist creator was an assignment for the course front end development at Winc Academy. <br />
